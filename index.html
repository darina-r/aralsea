  <h1>The Aral Sea: A Global Environmental Crisis</h1>
  <p>The Aral Sea, formerly the fourth-largest lake in the world, has nearly disappeared due to decades of unsustainable water management in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and neighboring countries. 
Each year, up to 80 million tons of toxic salts are lifted from the exposed seabed by wind, forming dust storms that spread over vast areas. 
This dust contains salts as well as residues of pesticides and herbicides that entered the Aral via river inflows, resulting in severe ecological degradation,
significant adverse effects on human health, and the collapse of local fisheries.</p>
